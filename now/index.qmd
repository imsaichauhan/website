I'm in a season of [deep focus/transition/building/exploration]. After [recent change or realization], I've been spending most of my energy on work that feels both challenging and necessary—the kind where you're not entirely sure you're doing it right, but you know you need to keep going.

Right now, I'm working on [primary project or focus area]. It started as [how it began], but it's evolved into something more interesting: [what it's become and why it matters]. The work is [adjective describing the experience—absorbing, frustrating, illuminating], and I'm learning that [insight about the process or yourself]. On the side, I'm also [secondary project], which gives me space to think about [related concept or application]. It's slower than I'd like, but I'm trying to trust that good work takes time.

I'm also spending time with [book, paper, or body of work] by [author], which has shifted how I think about [topic or approach]. There's this idea in it about [key concept] that keeps surfacing in my work—the sense that [how it connects to what you're doing]. I've also been reading [second book or source], mostly because [reason—curiosity, recommendation, research]. Between the two, I'm thinking a lot about [overarching theme or question].

Day to day, I'm based in [location], working from [where you work—home, office, cafe]. My routine is [description of rhythm—structured, fluid, evolving], and I'm trying to [habit or practice you're cultivating]. I've been saying no to [what you're actively avoiding—social media, certain types of projects, distractions] because I need the mental space for what I'm building. It's not that those things aren't valuable—they're just not for right now.

I'm not entirely sure where this all leads, but I'm okay with that. For now, I'm focused on [immediate next step or ongoing commitment], and seeing what emerges from consistent attention. If you want to talk about [topic you'd welcome conversation about], reach out—I'd love to hear from you.
