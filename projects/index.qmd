[Rivers are now battlefields](/projects/rivers-battlefields/)
:::
::: {.project-grid-separator}
:::
::: {.project-grid-description}
Chinese dams will hold billions of people downstream to ransom. Could solar-powered desalination make them irrelevant?

[Sunscreen for the planet](/projects/sunscreen-planet/)
:::
::: {.project-grid-separator}
:::
::: {.project-grid-description}
The world is warming faster than we can cut emissions. Volcanoes are already cooling the planet, with particles that reflect sunlight. Maybe we can too.
